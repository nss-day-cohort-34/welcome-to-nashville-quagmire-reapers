### Welcome To Nashville

This is a Readme file for the Welcome to Nashville project

Restaurants
The restaurant section will provide information on restaurants that are listed in the Open Table database 
in the Nashville market. It is based upon an open-source unofficial json API interface to search OpenTable restaurant data.
Base funtionality in this section provides a user a search button. The click event will return a listing of the 25 restaurants 
that are listed in the first page of returns from the api. 

Information returned:
- restaurant name
- street address, city, state
- reservation phone number
- restaurant URL

Parks
The parks section is a dropdown menu that will pull information on the API based on what you're looking for. 

Ex: "Dog Parks" will pull the six dog parks in the Nashville Area and display their name and address.

Future versions will allow the the user to save the park name and address to the itinerary.
